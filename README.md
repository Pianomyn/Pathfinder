# Pathfinder - A visualisation of various pathfinding algorithms
https://pianomyn.github.io/pathfinder/
<br/>
I initially built this webapp using Javascript, HTML and CSS when I was at university to help me visualize various pathfinding algorithms.
I wanted to keep working on this project after university but I didn't like raw Javascript and also wanted to learn some more frontend technologies so I started again using React, Typescript and Tailwind CSS.

## Basic Usage

# Algorithms
- BFS
    - Unweighted, shortest path algorithm
- DFS
    - Unweighted, does not guarantee shortest path
- Greedy
    - Unweighted, does not guarantee shortest path
- Djikstra
    - Weighted, shortest path algorithm
- A*
    - Weighted, shortest path algorithm using heuristics
